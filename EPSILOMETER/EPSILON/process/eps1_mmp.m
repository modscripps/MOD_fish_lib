%   Usage: epsilon=eps1_mmp(k,Psheark,kvis,w);
%      k is a vector array with wavenumber in cpm
%      Psheark is a vector array with the shear spectrum
%      kvis is the kinematic viscocity, in m^2/s
%      w is the vehicle speed, in m/s
%      dk is the elementary waveSD! 1enumber determined by eps1_mmp
%      epsilon is the estimated dissipation rate, in W/kg
%      kc is the wavenumber at which integration is cutoff, in cpm
%   Function: To integrate airfoil shear versus k spectra to
%      obtain epsilon.  The algorithm is similar to that of
%      Wesson & Gregg, 1994, JGR, 99, -9877, but uses Panchev's
%      universal spectrum for reference and stops integration to 
%      avoid vibration peaks.  This limit, kmax, is determined by eps2_mmp.

%    Epsilon is determined iteratively, in three stages.
%    (1) integration between 2 and 10 cpm, eps1
%          The observed spectrum is interpolated onto a wavenumber grid

%       between 2 and 10 cpm, with 0.2 cpm steps.  The integral, shear 10,
%       is compared with an integral of Panchev's universal spectrum over
%       the same grid.  If log10(shear10)>-3, 2 to 10 cpm lies solely in
%       the inertial subrange, which does not depend on viscosity.  Epsilon
%       is obtained directly from a polynomial fit of epsilon to shear10 for
%       the Panchev spectrum.  If log10(shear10)<=-3, 2 to 10 cpm contains at
%       least some of the viscous rolloff and epsilon/7.5 nu is obtained from
%       a polynomial fit to minimize errors due to viscosity.
%
%    (2) integration to the wavenumber containing 90% variance of Panchev's
%       spectrum evaluated with eps1 and nu, eps2
%         The upper limit for integration is reduced if it exceeds kmax, the limit
%       determined for noise-free spectra by script eps2_mmp.m.  The lower bound
%       is at 1 cpmk.  If fewer than 4 spectral estimates are in the wavenumber band, 
%       no integration is done and epsilon is set to 1e-10, taken as the base level.  
%       The estimate is raised by script epsilon_correct.m if the signal has been 
%       reduced by probe attenuation.
